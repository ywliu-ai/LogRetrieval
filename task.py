            Your task is to rewrite and integrate them into a single, structured query specification
            that can be directly consumed by a downstream Text-to-SQL agent.
            Input:
            1. User Question:
            {user_question}
            2. Extra Information:
            {extra_information}
            Instructions:
            - Integrate the user question and the extra information into ONE coherent query specification.
            - Make all implicit constraints explicit when supported by the inputs.
            - Use database-aligned terminology (tables, columns, conditions).
            - Resolve ambiguity conservatively; do not invent missing information.
            - Do NOT generate SQL.
            - Do NOT include execution steps or reasoning traces.
            Output:
            Follow EXACTLY the structured format required by the agent.""".format(
